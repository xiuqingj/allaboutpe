In order for the newly spawn machines successfully connect to the Primary server, you can consider the following 2 approaches.

First approach:
1. Generate the certificate for the newly provisioned machines on the Primary server. Example below.
puppetserver ca generate --certname machine1.com,machine2.com,machine3.com
2. Copy the following 2 files to the respective machines same directory from Primary server.
scp /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/machine1.com.pem machine1.com:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/machine1.com.pem
scp /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/private_keys/machine1.com.pem machine1.com:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/private_keys/machine1.com.pem
3. On the newly provsioned machine, update the file /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf for the certname under [main] session to the FQDN of the new machine. Example below.

[main]
server = primaryserver.machinename
certname = machine1.com
4.Run puppet agent -ton the newly provisioned machine which it will request for a SSL certificate the first time the agent contacts the Primary Server.

Second approach:
Perform steps 1-3 on the newly provisioned machines, and step 4 on Primary server.
1. Clean up the cert directory
rm -fr /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/*
2. Update file /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf for the certname under [main] session to the FQDN of the new machine. Example below.

[main]
server = primaryserver.machinename
certname = machine1.com
3.Run puppet agent -ton the newly provisioned machine which it will request for a SSL certificate the first time the agent contacts the Primary Server.

4.On Primary server, sign the cert.
puppetserver ca sign --certname machine1.com

For step 4, can consider /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/autosign.conf to auto sign the certificates. You can update your custom script for both approaches.
