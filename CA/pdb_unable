If PuppetDB is not running or cannot be reached, Puppet agent runs will encounter a 500 error:

    # puppet agent -t
    Info: Using configured environment 'production'
    Info: Retrieving pluginfacts
    Info: Retrieving plugin
    Info: Loading facts
    Error: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 500 on SERVER: Server Error: Failed to execute '/pdb/cmd/v1?checksum=7c2f9eabbba1bbfd8de78b0f0ac5a2d401104d58&version=5&certname=pe-201722-master.puppetdebug.vlan&command=replace_facts&producer-time

    Warning: Not using cache on failed catalog
    Error: Could not retrieve catalog; skipping run

Solution: restart the pdb 
puppet resource service pe-puppetdb ensure=stopped
puppet resource service pe-puppetdb ensure=running

If see Error: Failed to initialize SSL: The certificate 'CN=pemaster.local' has expired, verify time is synchronized, meaning the old cert is still around. 
Remove it : find /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl -name "$(puppet config print certname).pem -delete

If see: Failed to open TCP connection to puppet:8140 (Connection refused - connect(2) for "puppet" port 8140)
Error: No more routes to ca
Error: Could not run: No more routes to ca

Check puppet.conf under [agent] session.

Last resort to regen primary server certificate:

puppet resource service pe-puppetdb ensure=stopped
puppet infrastructure configure --no-recover
puppet infra status
puppet agent -t
