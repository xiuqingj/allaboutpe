(1). Backup /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ directory

(2). Copy-paste the content https://github.com/puppetlabs/ca_extend/blob/master/files/extend.sh and execute the extend.sh on the primary master. This will generate a new cert with formatting ca_crt-expireXXXX in ca folder.

(3). Open the generated file, copy the base64 part - contents starting from BEGIN CERTIFICATE to END CERTIFICATE and save it into a new file, for example, ca_crt_encoded.pem. Verify that the cert is valid with new expiry date:

openssl x509 -in ca_crt_encoded.pem -noout -text

(4). Copy the file to replace the following two old ca files:
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ca/ca_crt.pem
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem

(5). Run puppet agent -t on the master

(6). Distribute the new ca.pem to agents by removing the old ca.pem file from the above certs folder.
