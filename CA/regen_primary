Run in root, replacing <CERTNAME> with your Master's certname:

Stop the Puppet agent and PXP agent services:
puppet resource service puppet ensure=stopped
puppet resource service pxp-agent ensure=stopped             

Back up the /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ directory: cp -a /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl_bak/

Remove the cached catalog: rm -f /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache/client_data/catalog/<CERTNAME>.json

Revoke the master certificate: puppetserver ca clean --certname <CERTNAME> 

Delete the master certificates: find /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl -name $(puppet config print certname).pem -delete

Stop the Puppet Server service: puppet resource service pe-puppetserver ensure=stopped

Rebuild certificates: puppet infrastructure configure --no-recover

Run Puppet: puppet agent -t

When regen failed:

cp -a /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl_backup

Manually clean up any certs or keys for the primary:
find /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/ -name "$(puppet config print certname).pem" -delete

Follow by running the below command:

puppet infrastructure configure --no-recover --dns_alt_names="puppet","puppet6-xxxxx"
Run puppet agent -t
