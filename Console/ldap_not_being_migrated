Need to reset the LDAP access from RBAC. Please run through the following steps. On primary server harmony3-p1.anu.edu.au, as root, run the following:

su pe-postgres -c /opt/puppetlabs/server/bin/psql -s /bin/bash
And at the pe-postgres=# prompt, run the following commands:

\c pe-rbac

DELETE from external_access_config where config_type = "LDAP";
Once that done, you can type exit and systemctl restart pe-console-services to get everything back up and running.
