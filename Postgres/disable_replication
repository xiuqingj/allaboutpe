All the steps are on the primary server:

(1) disable puppet agent temporarily on the Primary Server:

puppet agent --disable
(2) Edit /opt/puppetlabs/server/data/postgresql/11/data/pg_ident.conf, comment out all the lines with pe-ha-replication-map, you should be able to see 10 lines, examples:

#pe-activity-pe-ha-replication-map puppetmom-replica.platform9.puppet.net pe-ha-replication
#pe-classifier-pe-ha-replication-map puppetmom-replica.platform9.puppet.net pe-ha-replication
#pe-inventory-pe-ha-replication-map puppetmom-replica.platform9.puppet.net pe-ha-replication
#pe-orchestrator-pe-ha-replication-map puppetmom-replica.platform9.puppet.net pe-ha-replication
#pe-rbac-pe-ha-replication-map puppetmom-replica.platform9.puppet.net pe-ha-replication
......
(3) Restart pe-postgresql service:

systemctl restart pe-postgresql
(4) Drop the replication slots:

SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot(slot_name) FROM pg_replication_slots WHERE slot_name LIKE 'pgl_pe_%';
CHECKPOINT;
Confirm there are no errors.

(5) enable puppet agent

puppet agent --enable
Once done, all the 5 replications should have been cleared. You can use the previous commands to confirm:

su -s /bin/bash pe-postgres -c /opt/puppetlabs/server/bin/psql

SELECT slot_name, pg_size_pretty(pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(),restart_lsn)) AS wal_lag FROM pg_replication_slots;
