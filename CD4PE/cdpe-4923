This issue looks similar to one SCB encountered last year (see CDPE-3871) and an internal one reported in CDPE-3753. A couple of the workarounds that seemed to work in those situations are:

- We use PaC, and to resolve this I flipped between managing pipelines in the UI and back again and the missing pipeline was restored.
- Push the cd4pe.yaml file again from the codebase & validate the code (Validate under Manage as code). All pipelines are now showing properly.
