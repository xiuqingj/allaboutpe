Manual way to convert compiler:
(1) Update csr_attribultes.yaml on the compiler:

/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/csr_attributes.yaml
By adding a needed extension:

---
extension_requests:
  pp_auth_role: pe_compiler

(2) Disable puppet agent: puppet agent --disable

(3) Remove SSL directory:
rm -rf /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl

(4) Clean the cert from MoM:

puppetserver ca clean --certname <compiler cert>
(5) Enable agent on compiler and run puppet agent

(6) Sign the cert:
puppetserver ca sign --certname <compiler cert>

(7) Run puppet agent -t at least twice on compiler. Then run puppet agent -t on primary server and replica.

(8) Confirm pe-puppetdb service has been installed. puppet infra status shows the converted compiler status successfully. Checked some other places like puppetdb.conf, database.ini to confirm it is configured as expected.
