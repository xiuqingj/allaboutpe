Issue: After upgrading to 2021.6, code deployment no longer syncs module changes when made within the specified branch in the Puppetfile. Ticket 48551

Upgrade r10k
Need to have internet access on the primary, just run:
/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install r10k -v 3.14.2

If not, you can download it from https://rubygems.org/gems/r10k/versions/3.14.2, copy it to the primary, and run:
/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install --local r10k-3.14.2.gem

If there are issues, the r10k update can be rolled back with the following command.
/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem uninstall r10k -v 3.14.2

After installing the gem, try another code deployment to validate if the issue persists.

If it does, please send the output of a manual r10k deployment with debug2 logging. You can replace production with any environment that you see the issue with.

sudo -H -u pe-puppet bash -c '/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/r10k deploy environment production -c /opt/puppetlabs/server/data/code-manager/r10k.yaml -p -v debug2'

After all these procedures, issue persists.

To confirm r10k version:
 /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem list r10k 

 The Puppetfile uses :commit instead of :branch. Since the :commit is used and the Puppetfile in the control repo has not changed, --incremental flag will not sync it by design.

Change from:

mod 'diaag_imaging_server',
 :git    => 'git@xxxxxx:dgit/diaag_imaging_server.git',
 :commit => 'development'
 
to the following solved the issue. 

mod 'diaag_imaging_server',
 :git    => 'git@xxxxx:dgit/diaag_imaging_server.git',
 :branch => 'development'
