# run the following command on your primary server and paste the output in the ticket:

sudo -H -u pe-puppet bash -c  '/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/r10k deploy environment pupp_683 -c /opt/puppetlabs/server/data/code-manager/r10k.yaml -p -v debug2'

sudo -H -u pe-puppet bash -c  '/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/r10k deploy environment <ENVIRONMENT> -c /opt/puppetlabs/server/data/code-manager/r10k.yaml -p -v debug2'

time runuser -u pe-puppet -- r10k deploy environment --config /opt/puppetlabs/server/data/code-manager/r10k.yaml -p pupp_683

Can see the deployment went ok, but just the checkin time is 13 days before.

Could you please try to restart the pe-puppetserver service on Primary server

systemctl stop pe-puppetserver
systemctl start pe-puppetserver
and try to do the code deployment again.

 puppet code deploy pupp_683 --wait
